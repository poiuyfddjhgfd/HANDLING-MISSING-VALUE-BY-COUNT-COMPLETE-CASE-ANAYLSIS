# Handling Missing Values by Complete Case Analysis

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates how to handle missing data using the **Complete Case Analysis** method.

## 📘 Overview

Missing values are a common issue in data analysis. Complete Case Analysis (also known as listwise deletion) removes any rows that contain missing values before performing analysis.  
This notebook illustrates:
- How to identify missing values.
- How to apply complete case analysis.
- How to verify the dataset after handling missing data.

## 🧠 Techniques Used
- **Pandas** for data manipulation
- **NumPy** for numerical operations
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn** for visualization (if applicable)

## 🛠️ Requirements

To run this notebook, install the dependencies:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn jupyter
